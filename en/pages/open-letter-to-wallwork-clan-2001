Open Letter To The Wallwork Clan - 2001
</p><h1>Open Letter To The Wallwork Clan - 2001</h1>
<p>This letter contains information as it was known in 2001 and is not 
necasarily true now. This letter is provided for archive purposes only. 
The more recent 2005 letter can be found <a href="/en/pages/open-letter-to-wallwork-clan-2005" title="">here</a>.</p>
<p>The project to search for my ancestors was started in 1999.
At first just working on my family line and researching the
history of southeast Lancashire, because that was the area my
father came from looking for work in 1923. Then widening the
search to call in all our kith and kin in the United Kingdom,
with surprising results.</p>
<p>I used the I.G.I as a search tool on the internet to find all the Wallwork's
in five periods 1535 to 1600 -1650-1700-1750-1800. Based on the parish
records of marriages, births and christenings, I discovered that only
very few had ventured out of that corner of Lancashire which was the Wallwork
heart- land. In the UK census of 1881 you will find 1576 Wallwork's living
in Lancashire and only 234 in the rest of England. The 234 are made up
of eleven families in Cheshire (just over the boundary) and six families
in County Durham. As for the rest they were mostly journeymen, tradesmen,
female servants, visitors or boys away at school. Only one man living
in Ayr Scotland. The majority of our small tribe lived within a 25 miles
radius of the centre of Manchester.</p>
<p>By the way, the 1881 census on CD is a mine full of facts, you can see
where families lived, where they were born, what they did for a living,
and their marriage status. Every page has a story to tell, some sad, some
not. It's all about the Wallwork's! Think of young Frances 7 years old
who was an inmate at St Pancreas Industrial School, Leavesden, Watford,
Herts. He was listed as a pauper. Then at the other end of the Wallwork's
social scale we have Henry Wallwork aged 50, an iron founder employing
150 men and boys. He lived with his wife Mary who was 38 at 261York Cheetham.
They had two boys, two girls and domestic servants, was it a sweet life?
The next census might tell us!</p>
<p>At this point I would like to discuss the spelling of our name, this
is the range I have come across so far:</p>
<p>The earliest was christened Doritye Dorothy WALWORKE on the 26<sup>th</sup>
March 1558 in Radcliff Parish, her father was Elyce Ellce WALWORKE.</p>

<p>Misspelling was very common in the early Parish registers, spelling became
more standardised in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century. I take the overall view,
making allowances (as spelling is not my strong point). For example the
chaplain at St Mary's, Oldham, 1665-1669 was sometimes known by the name
'Walworth and at other times by the name Walwork'. A modern mistake was
made in the 1881Census when the census taker made an error and spelt BETHELL
WALLWORK as <em>Wallnork</em>, he was my grandfather and because of this
mistake he took a lot of finding.</p>
<p>The Wallworth's are not of our family, a different tribe altogether in
my view! The Census of 1881 numbers them at 8600-spread throughout England
mostly in the south, only 150 in Lancashire answered to that name. William
Walworth was the famous Lord Mayor of London 1374 -1380 who cut off the
head of Watt Tyler the rebel peasant leader, but I cannot claim him as
one of ours! At that time I think our little group of families would have
been tucked away in the Salford Hundreds, hard working builders, farmers,
spinners, weavers, and miners. Working in tune with the seasons trying
to keep a roof over their heads, a full belly and out of trouble.</p>
<h2>MY FAMILY LINE</h2>
<p>I have traced my family line back to:</p>
<p>JOHN WALLWORK born 1724 in the Oldham area. He married RUTH LEES on
26th January 1748 at St Mary's, Oldham. I have only been able to trace
RUTH LEES parents so far. RUTH's parents were:</p>
<ul>
<li>GEORGE LEES born 1671 in Oldham</li>
<li>HANNAH WHITTAKER born 1675 Oldham (I think this is where a close association
with the Whittakers' began, see <a href="#twoa">The Wallwork's of
Oldham</a> below.)</li></ul>
<p>JOHN WALLWORK and RUTH LEES were blessed with 3 children:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAMES born 1<sup>st</sup> December 1749 (he died young)</li>
<li>ANN born 10<sup>th</sup> November 1751 at Priesthill an old ward of Oldham.</li>
<li>JAMES born 9<sup>th</sup> September 1753 he was my great great great grandfather and was christened in Saint Mary's, Oldham.</li></ul>
<p>JAMES married MARTHA BARDLEY on the 15<sup>th</sup> April 1773, she was
22 and they had 12 children: (some died young)</p>
<ul>
<li>THOMAS born 22<sup>nd</sup> December 1776</li>
<li>BETTY born 30<sup>th</sup> May 1779</li>
<li>JAMES born 8<sup>th</sup> July 1781</li>
<li>MARTHA born 15<sup>th</sup> June 1783</li>
<li>ROBERT born 30<sup>th</sup> October 1785</li>
<li>ROBERT born 19<sup>th</sup> August 1787</li>
<li>JOSEPH born 18<sup>th</sup> April 1790</li>
<li>JOSEPH born 4<sup>th</sup> December 1791</li>
<li>JOSHUA born 1793</li>
<li>JOSEPH born 11<sup>th</sup> September 1796</li></ul>
<p>JOSEPH, the last born (11<sup>th</sup> September 1796), was my great
great grandfather, and married MARY LOFTUS in Saint Michael, Ashton under
Lyne on the 3<sup>rd</sup> February 1818 by licence. I have a copy of
the marriage bond and a photo of the entry in the parish register. </p>
<p>Their son ISIAH was my great grandfather and ISIAH'S son BETHELL was
my grandfather. My father FREDERICK WILLIAM was born 8<sup>th</sup> Nov
1890 and I was born 22<sup>nd</sup> Sept 1926. I have a printed family
group sheet for each of my family line, in three different formats.</p>
<p>If anyone has any more information please could they let me know.
If you are a Wallwork outside the UK, I would be especially interested
in hearing from you.</p>
<h2>HISTORY OF OLDHAM</h2>
<p>Oldham is in the Parish of Prestwick which is part of the Salford Hundred,
Lancashire. Kaskenmoor manor included Oldham and most of Cromton in 1212.
Oldham did not become a Parish until 1850. Then the church of St Mary
had its own vicar, before that the Rector who had the living of the parish
could appoint parochial chaplains or curates to cover all the outlying
churches. John Walwork was there 1665-1669, he was made responsible for
the upkeep of the vicarage, he must have been very poor! I don't know
yet whether he ever married or went on to have a better life.</p>
<p>Daniel Defoe in 1717 records his impressions of the Oldham district.</p>
<p><em>"This country seems to have been designed by providence for the very
purposes to which it is now allotted for carrying on a manufacture, which
can nowhere be so easily Supplied with the conveniences necessary for
it .Nor is the industry of the people.Wanting to second these advantages.
Though we met few people outdoors, yet within we saw the houses full of
lusty fellows, some at dye vats, some at looms, other dressing the cloths;
the women and children carding and spinning; all employed from the youngest
to the oldest, scarce anything above four years old but its hands were
sufficient for its own support.not a beggar to be seen not a idle person,
except here and there in the alms house, built for those that are ancient
and past work. The people in general live long; they enjoy a good air,
and such circumstances hard labour is naturally attended with the blessing
of health, if not riches. The sides of the hills were dotted with homes
hardly a home standing out of speaking distance from another; and the
land being divided into small plots or enclosures, every three or four
pieces of land had a house belonging to them. In the course of our road
among the houses we found at every one of them a little rill or gutter
of running water at every house of size was a manufactory, which could
not have carried on without water, these small streams were so parted
and guided by gutters and pipes that not one of the houses wanted for
a rivulet. The scouring dye houses and where the water was used it was
tinged with the drugs of soap, dye, oil, tallow, and other ingredients
used for dressing and scouring the cloth. The lands through which it passes
would be exceedingly barren, and are now enriched by it beyond imagination.</em></p>
<p><em>Every clothier keeps at least one horse to fetch home his wool and provisions
from the market, to take the finished goods to be sold each family keeps
a cow or two by this means the small pieces of enclosed land fed the family.
As for corn, they scarce grow enough to feed their poultry."</em></p>
<p>An environmental disaster in the making.</p><a name="twoa"></a>
<h2>THE WALLWORKS OF OLDHAM</h2>
<p>The most likely employment was coal/iron mining, blacksmith and building.
These skills would have passed from father to sons. Trades and artisan
much sort after in the new industrial age. There was spinning and weaving
wool at home then as demand increased for cotton it was spun in the mills.
Women and children toiled at the mills for a wage. (This was a new era
women and children being paid to work away from the family home). The
man would still work the small holding (toff and croft) though most of
the time he would be at his weaving loom until daylight faded. A hard
life where infant mortality was high due to poor drainage, water supply
and housing, as well as the working conditions.</p>
<p>The Oldham cotton spinner, John Whittaker, relocated to Hurst in 1808.
Most of his work force followed him. Joseph Wallwork moved from Oldham
to Hurst and was married at St Michael Ashton 1818 and eventually became
a manager in a mill presumably working for Mr John Whittaker. Hurst is
a case of the early industrial movement to a Greenfield site where the
owner undertook to build a community around his ever expanding factory,
with modern housing, school and a chapel, employing a thousand people.
The 1848 map shows school, chapel and rows of 'modern' housing, with slightly
larger houses for the managers. Some of which still survive today. Hope
Street was where my ancestors lived. At house number 88 great grandfather
Isiah lived, at number 83 Grandfather Bethell had a grocers shop where
my father Frederick was born. In Princes St great uncles Handel, Ben,
Cyrus and John lived. Queens St housed at one time great great Grandfather
Joseph the patriarch father of all.</p>
<p>John Whittaker died in 1840 leaving a mill and four sons John, Oldham,
Robert and James (Oldham is a significant name in the Wallwork family).
Only John and Oldham played a part in the business proving to be at least
as capable as their father. Oldham built his own mill in 1847 just down
the road, nearer to the new housing estate. The two brothers employed
most of the population of Hurst at Whittaker Mills and like their father
before them were humane employers. They made generous efforts to alleviate
the suffering of workers during the worst years of the cotton famine (1862-1864).</p>
<p>John Whittaker jnr died in 1864 leaving his brother two large mills.
Oldham Whittaker died on the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 1871 leaving
his mills to his son and son-in-law.</p>
<p>St. John's Church, a new church benefited from the generosity of Oldham
and John. Oldham gave Â£1,000 to the building fund and Â£3,600 towards the
spire and transepts. John gave similar sums of money to the Queens Road
Methodist New Connections Chapel.</p>
<p>Three Canal companies joined together at Ashton from 1795, the canals
were bought out by the railway companies (1840-1845) and were subsequently
run down.</p>

<p>There will be mistakes and omissions, it's just down to time and space.
Look on this short paper as a foundation on which to build, the truth is out there.</p>
