Open Letter To The Wallwork Clan - 2005
</p><h1>Open Letter To The Wallwork Clan - 2005</h1>
The 1907 OS map of Oldham shows a Wallwork Street to the north west of the Market ground (<a href="#map">see map below</a>).
 This is the likely site of a place called WALLWORK FOLD. Some of our 
folk were born and married here, it's on the parish records. The area 
was most likely replaced with a street named after the smallholding or 
farmstead when villages and hamlets exploded into industrial sprawl.
<p>The street of some 20 buildings was knocked down during the rebuilding of Oldham in the nineteen fifties.</p>
<p>The new street atlas for Greater Manchester printed by the AA has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wallwork Close, Bamford.</li>
<li>Wallwork Road, off Chaddock Lane Ashley.</li>
<li>Wallwork Street, off Old Wheeler Street Openshaw.</li></ul>
<p>I would like to know why our name was honoured, how about you? Maybe in memory of the Wallwork fold, gone, but not forgotten.</p>
<p>The 1891 census has John Wallwork naggar maker living at No 4 
Wallwork St Openshaw with Ann his Wife, and Lisa his niece (a spinner). 
He was then 48 years old and lived there until his death in 1915, he 
left a will.<br>
Talking of wills, my great uncles' all left wills showing the houses 
they owned in King St, Princess St and Hope St Hurst. This summer I 
tried in the rain to take photos of some of them. The ones that still 
stand look in good condition and much loved. Great Uncle Handel would 
have been very well pleased.</p>
<p>The Wallworks made up less than 1% of the population in Lancashire 
(The 1881 census shows only eighteen hundred and ten Wallworks 
registered in the whole of England).<br>
Going back in time to a smaller population, and therefore fewer 
Wallworks,
I am encouraged that we have found so many names from quite a small 
community of Wallworks living and working in the southeast corner of 
Lancashire (called the Salford Hundred in medieval times).</p>
<p>For the archives I have made a location map showing most of the 
sites.  Copies of Joseph and Marys' marriage bond 1818 also 5 wills of 
their sons, many births, deaths, marriages and christening certificates.<br>
There are many gaps to fill, of course additions will be made as more 
information becomes available and mistakes can be rectified.</p>
<p>The way forward! or should I say backward? Is, I think, to look at 
the misspelling of our name and see if we can come up with some likely 
parents and dates for John Wallworth /Wallwork.</p>

<h2>MY FAMILY LINE</h2>
<p>The Family History of Raymond Wallwork now residing in Allesley, Coventry.</p>
<p>Firstly the surname Wallworth and Wallwork cross over from time to time in the
early years.<br>
It is difficult to be precise in the early period but every effort
has been made to establish the actual turn of events based on the generally held
view that John Wallwork (the elder) married twice.</p>
<h2>JOHN WALLWORK THE ELDER</h2>
<p>JOHN WALLWORK (known as John the elder) born about 1705, his parents names and
dates as yet unknown, married his first bride ELIZABETH WHITEHEAD on the 19<sup>th</sup> January 1730 at St. Mary Oldham as (JOHN WALLWORTH).  Elizabeth Whitehead was
baptised 11<sup>th</sup> November 1711 of Samuel and Alice Whitehead (nee Low) at Oldham.  Elizabeth
(now again Wallwork) was buried there 10<sup>th</sup> January 1747 aged 36, the value of her estate being under £10 to JOHN by administration.</p>
<p>No details as yet on the death of John but 1761 onwards.</p>
<p>Therefore being the Great, Great, Great, Great, Great Grandparents of Ray Wallwork.</p>
<p>Note: John was Church Warden in 1744 and 45, 1752 to 54 and 1755 to 1761.</p>
<p>The children of the above were all baptised at Oldham with the name of WALLWORK. They were as follows:</p>

<p>NOTE: To obtain the list of the above children it was necessary to input the
baptism of John 1731, click on family and obtain the list of children.  This cannot
be found by the input of the marriage, this says children "None".  All the children
on the above list are verified by the "Oldham parish registers" as transcribed
by Giles Shaw, 1889.</p>
<p>John Wallwork (was Wallworth) married Mrs Ruth Lees on 26<sup>th</sup> January 1748. This was the second marriage for both of them, they had both been widowed.</p>
<p>It appears that Ruth is the Ruth Lees baptised 26<sup>th</sup> August 1713 of George and Hannah (nee) Whitaker at Oldham.  Ruth Lees married a namesake Edward Lees 26<sup>th</sup> August 1733 at St. Mary Oldham.<br>
Ruth Lees now Ruth Wallwork, died 6<sup>th</sup> November 1756.</p>
<p>The children of the above were baptised at Oldham and are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
James</td>
<td valign="top">
1<sup>st</sup> Dec</td>
<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

<p>So, from the nine children of the two marriages four died by the age 
of 24. Again the details are as the register, Giles Shaw 1889, with the 
exception of the death of James 1797.</p>
<h2>JOHN WALLWORK THE YOUNGER</h2>
<p>John Wallwork (The younger of Priest Hill) baptised as said 19<sup>th</sup> September 1731 at St. Mary Oldham, the eldest son of John Wallwork (the elder) and Elizabeth Whitehead.</p>
<p>John Wallwork married Sarah Needham at St. Mary Oldham 27<sup>th</sup> May 1750. Sarah Needham baptised of John Needham and Anne (nee Whitaker) 9<sup>th</sup> February 1729 at St. Mary Oldham.  Note: Born at North Moor.</p>
<p>John Needham married Anne Whitaker 31<sup>st</sup> December 1724 at St. Mary Oldham.</p>
<p>John Wallwork buried at Oldham 5<sup>th</sup> March 1797.</p>
<p>There are conflicting details at this point. See IGI marriage of John Wallwork
and Sarah Needham 27<sup>th</sup> May 1950 (clearly an error) should 
read 1750 (see children) the details of the children may have been added
 by a family member, they are listed as the probable
family.</p>
